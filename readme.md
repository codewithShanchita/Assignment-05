1. What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll?

Ans:

getElementById("id") → Gets one element by its id.

getElementsByClassName("class") → Gets many elements with the same class.

querySelector("selector") → Gets the first element that matches a CSS rule (#id, .class, tag).

querySelectorAll("selector") → Gets all elements that match a CSS rule.
